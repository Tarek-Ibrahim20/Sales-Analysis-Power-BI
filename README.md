# Project Overview:
## Power BI project using direct query mode by connecting to SQL Sever.
The project involved connecting to Adventureworks transactional database.
We collected the desired data tables and user defined functions from Microsoft SQL Server by using Power Query.
### Data Preparation
![Data Preparation](https://github.com/Tarek-Ibrahim20/Sales-Analysis-Project-Power-BI/blob/80eb1d7b14f957171c4a1ea4b4c41ecc4d37afde/Data%20Preparation.png)
created a robust data model, we implemented a star schema using Power BI Data Model, this schema required various transformations due to its complexity. 
Additionally, we developed a date dimension using Power Query and DAX, and implemented several measures using DAX.
### Data Model

The main focus of the project was data visualization using Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities. We created three pages in the report.
The first page presented sales data, including sales over time and the top salespersons based on the due amount.
We visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures such as the number of orders, total subtotal, total due, total tax, total freight, and total quantities sold.
### Sales Dashboard

The second page revolved around order analysis. We compared orders, shipments, and due dates using a single chart with three lines. Additionally, we explored quantities sold per category and paired them with specific days.
### Orders Report
![Orders](https://github.com/Tarek-Ibrahim20/Sales-Analysis-Project-Power-BI/blob/3427bcbd82f99175c1ed17297a82e523bc472cb3/Orders%20Report.png)
The third page focused on territory analysis. We examined the number of orders and total due for each country, providing insights into sales performance across different regions.
### Territory Report

Overall, this project allowed us to effectively present the required information and gain valuable insights using the advanced data visualization capabilities of Power BI Software.
